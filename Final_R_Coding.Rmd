Covid-19 data from Jan 1, 2020 and Dec 31, 2022 was reported below in each country as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO).
To View Mortality Rate, Case Fatality Rate and Prevalence of COVID-19, please zoom in and click on a country!

Note: Countries in white did not have available COVID-19 Data for the calculations, also some countries may have NA values due to lack of information

# Covid + Socioeconomic Factors

## Row {data-height="100"}

Chart 1 - Case Fatality Rate according to GDP: In the graph below, case fatality rates are being compared to each Countryâ€™s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to form a scatter plot. The majority of the data points form a vertical line, which signifies that even with different rates of fatality, GDP stays consistent throughout. There are a few outliers, but the majority do not stray from the line.  

Chart 2 - Case Fatality according to Income: In the second graph, case fatality rates are being compared to the different levels of the average population's income of various countries. Income levels were divided into 5 categories:

- High Income
- Low Income 
- Lower Middle Income 
- Not Classified 
- Upper Middle Income

As can be seen by the box plots, the mean case fatality is higher for the "Low Income" and "Lower Middle Income" categories. This signifies that there are more case fatalities for countries in which the average person has a lower income. 
The mean case fatality is lower for the "Upper Income" and "Upper Middle Income" categories, with the prior have the lowest mean.

Chart 3 - Case Fatality Rate According to Unemployment Rate: In the third graph, case fatality rates are being compared to the unemployment rates of each country. As can be seen by the scatter plot, a positive relationship is established between the two variables. The higher the unemployment rate, the higher the case fatality rate is.
